# Entry 3
##### 1/5/19

Me and my partner have commited to Swift, like it was stated in my last blog entry. We didn't finish working on the meal planner app since we were still a little unsure if Karla wanted to fully decide to be my partner. When we did decide that we were working together we started on a new mini project from scratch. It would be helpful for the both of us to work on something that was fresh for the both of us.
