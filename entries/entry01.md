I would like to learn SWIFT in order to create a app for the HSTAT community.
Last year I worked with a partner Mandy Mei, to make a website for SGO.
I would like to continue on that idea but expand it a little bit more.
Many students don't know who represents them on SGO or even what we do. It would be great for them to know our faces
and to have a platform specifically from us to the rest of the community.

This app would send notifications to students about events and an occasional inspirational quote.
There would also be a feed page where all of the events/pictures are posted. Students and teachers
can communicate through the app (like remind), and Teachers can post on it but students can submit a request.
