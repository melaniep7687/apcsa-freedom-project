Since my last blog entry, I now have a partner and we have decided to use Swift to make our app. We are still in our planning stage for our
project but we want to learn ehat we can do with Swift before we finalize our ideas for the app. We started tinkering with Xcode, a program
needed in order to do Swift.
We started working on a [meal planner app](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/)
as a way to get to know Xcode and Swift. We learned that we will need to use a collaborating platform later on because when using the meal planning
app we couldn't both work on it at the same time. We won't have to worry about that right now since we're still trying to learn how to work with
Xcode but at least we know it's something that we will come across with in the future. We did a little research into this and put some helpful links
into a google doc that we both share. We have also been adding in our ideas for the app and notes on what we have learned into the doc. We have also
downloaded an app on our phones called Code Swift that we can use to learn Swift when were on the go. When using this app we realized that Swift is
similar to Java and other coding languages, but it does have it's little differences here and there. Having a partner on this project has helped me
work on my communication skills, especially when looking for resources to learn from or sharing notes when learning from Code Swift.
